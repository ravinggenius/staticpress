# Content Types

Staticpress supports many formats for content. To do so, Staticpress uses [Tilt](https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt) under the covers. You can mix and match format as much as you like. Additionally you can create pages in any format; if Tilt does not recognize the file, it will be copied through untouched. This is useful for including images in your posts for instance.
